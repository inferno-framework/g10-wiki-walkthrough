Inferno is an open source tool that tests whether patients can access their health data through a standard interface.
It makes HTTP(S) requests to test your server's conformance to authentication, authorization, and FHIR content standards and reports the results back to you.

This wiki will be periodically updated with product documentation, installation/integration instructions, and other helpful materials.  If you are unable to find the help that you need on this Wiki, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program/issues).

If you are new to FHIR or SMART-on-FHIR, you may want to review the [Inferno Walkthrough](https://github.com/onc-healthit/inferno-program/wiki/Walkthrough).
