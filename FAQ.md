### Q: How does Inferno test US Core Encounter resource?
**A:** Inferno Encounter test is only concerned with references to Encounter resources that it knows MUST support the US Core Encounter profile. And it turns out that not all references to Encounter resources within other US Core profiles need to conform to the US Core Encounter profile. For an example of a reference to `Reference(US Core Encounter)`, see [US Core DiagnosticReport Note](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-diagnosticreport-note.html)'s `encounter` element. [US Core DocumentReference](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU3.1.1/StructureDefinition-us-core-documentreference.html)'s `context.encounter` is another example. If you place encounter references in one of those spots, you should start getting references that are tested in the Encounter test. Note: US Core has two profiles for DiagnosticReport. Only the DiagnosticReport Note profile mentioned above has US Core Encounter reference. The other profile (US Core DiangosticReport Lab Result) does NOT have US Core Encounter reference.
